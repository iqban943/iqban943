<h1><a href="index.html">(love song, with two goldfish)</a></h1>

  <br>(He's a drifter, always</br>
  <br>floating around her, has</br>
  <br>nowhere else to go. He wishes</br>
  <br>she would sing, not much, just the <a href="scales2.html">scales;</a></br>
  <br>or take some notice,</br>
  <br>give him the fish eye.)</br>
  <br></br>
  <br>(Bounded by round walls</br>
  <br>she makes fish eyes</br>
  <br>and kissy lips at him, darts</br>
  <br>behind pebbles, swallows</br>
  <br>his charms hook, line and sinker)</br>
  <br></br>
  <br>(He's bowled over. He would</br>
  <br>take her to the ocean, they could</br>
  <br>count the waves. There,</br>
  <br>in the submarine silence, they would share</br>
  <br>their deepest secrets. Dive for pearls</br>
  <br>like stars.)</br>
  <br></br>
  <br>(But her love's since</br>
  <br>gone belly-up. His heart sinks</br>
  <br>like a fish. He drinks</br>
  <br>like a stone. Drowns those sorrows,</br>
  <br>stares emptily through glass.)</br>
  <br></br>
  <br>(the reason, she said</br>
  <br>she wanted)</br>
  <br>(and he could not give)</br>
  <br>a life</br>
  <br>beyond the</br>
  <br>(bowl)</br>
